# TODO-App
Author : Miguel Angel Francisco


Description :
  A simple todo program built with vanilla HTML,CSS,and Javascript. As the title explains, you input a todo and add it,
  which then will make it appear on the screen. After you complete the task, you can press on the 'x' button to remove it. 
  
  As it utilizes localStorage, this allows to close out from the application, and as long as you use the same device, it should 
  bring up undeleted todos.
  
  Also has a sort button that will put the tasks with the highest priority on top of the list, meanwhile the least important at the bottom.
